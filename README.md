# GeoSew
Jo-Ann Stores was the go to retailer for fabric, sewing supplies, and crafting essesntials serving sewists, hobbyists, and beginners alike. Unfortunately, Jo-Ann closed its doors at the end of May 2025, leaving many without a reliable fabric store. This project aims to fill that gap by mapping independent fabric, quilt, and sewing shops, making it easier for makers to find nearby resources and support small businesses.
